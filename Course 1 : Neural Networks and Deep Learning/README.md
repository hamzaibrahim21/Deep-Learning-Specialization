# Course 1
## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

##### The first course of Deep learning specialization gives a foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. [Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/bee3ce545eefe6b076acacfbaec04cbf)

It familiarizes you with build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## Schedule
## Week 1
**Learning Objectives**
- Discuss the major trends driving the rise of deep learning.
- Explain how deep learning is applied to supervised learning
- List the major categories of models (CNNs, RNNs, etc.), and when they should be applied
- Assess appropriate use cases for deep learning

## Week 2
**Learning Objectives**
- Build a logistic regression model structured as a shallow neural network
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including parameter initialization, cost function and gradient calculation, and optimization implemetation (gradient descent)
- Implement computationally efficient and highly vectorized versions of models
- Compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset
- Use Numpy functions and Numpy matrix/vector operations
- Work with iPython Notebooks
- Implement vectorization across multiple training examples
- Explain the concept of broadcasting

## Week 3
**Learning Objectives**
- Describe hidden units and hidden layers
- Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
- Implement forward and backward propagation
- Apply random initialization to your neural network
- Increase fluency in Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations
- Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
- Compute the cross entropy loss

## Week 4
**Learning Objectives**
- Describe the successive block structure of a deep neural network
- Build a deep L-layer neural network
- Analyze matrix and vector dimensions to check neural network implementations
